The event attracted over 200 athletes from across all seven emirates, competing in various weight classes and skill levels.\n\nOrganized by the UAE Mixed Martial Arts Federation (UAEMMAF), the championship showcased the rapid development of MMA in the UAE since the federation's establishment in 2021. The tournament featured both male and female competitors, with particularly strong performances from the youth divisions, highlighting the effectiveness of grassroots development programs implemented over the past two years.\n\nHH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who attended the final day of competition, expressed his satisfaction with the growth of the sport, stating: \"The impressive level of talent displayed during this championship reflects the UAE's commitment to developing all sports, including mixed martial arts. We are proud to see Emirati athletes competing at such a high level.\"\n\nThe championship also served as a qualifier for the upcoming IMMAF World Championship, with the top performers earning spots on the national team that will represent the UAE on the global stage. The selected athletes will now enter an intensive training camp supervised by international coaches brought in by the UAEMMAF.\n\nBeyond the competitive aspect, the event featured educational workshops on proper training techniques, injury prevention, and sports nutrition, aligning with the federation's holistic approach to athlete development.\n\nAs MMA continues to gain popularity in the UAE, the UAEMMAF has announced plans to increase the frequency of national competitions and expand training facilities across the country, ensuring that aspiring fighters have access to proper coaching and resources regardless of their location.",
